    <!-- It is not a good practice to use react through cdn links -->
    <!-- What is crossorigin -->
    <!-- why there are two files -->
     <!-- first one is core file of react -->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <!-- second one is react dom, this is used to modify dom -->
     <!-- why react made differnt file for both of them ? -->
    <!-- Ans: because react does not work only in browser it works on mobiles also for example (react native) -->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
    


    <!-- <script src="app.js"></script> this will not work as it will trat app.js as normal js and normal js does not knows what import is so we will resolve this issue using type="module" -->
    <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>

    <!-- using react for the first time -->
